Currently still being worked on so won't merge any pr for now


# Quick Guide

# Mentions
This is really just for the "funsies" and probably a good idea to not use it for legal stuff. 

If you want to verify your ownership of an digital asset, use Keybase or something similar to that.

This Process uses a simple dns record to verify your ownership, each asset wil be given an unique id. 

This process will be all manual as This "proof of ownership" will be only be used for ASOP Education. 

You are welcome to add your own digital assets but if you are using it for mailcious purposes / bad intent, will be removed.

If you want a free proof of ownership, that is 100% free, i suggest you check out https://fairregister.net/ or something in a similar mannar. 

Thank You!
